# SwiftUI-ListView
This project demonstrates a way to show and modify an array of Strings as a list.

## Description
Sometimes you have a simple array of strings, and you want your user to be able to modify the array. Of course in order to modify the array you have to be able to see what's already in it, and that's where this simple project comes in. A bonus here is that the array is automatically stored in User Defaults.
